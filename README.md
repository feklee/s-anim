Introduction
============

*s-anim* is short for *stereographic animator*. It remaps a set of
equirectangular images to a set of images in stereographic projection, also
known as little planet projection. For remapping, keyframes can be specified,
to create something akin to a camera path.


Installation
============

 1. Install using the *npm* package manager for *Node.js:*

        npm install -g s-anim

 2. Install *Hugin 2013* or compatible, and make sure that the included command
    line tool `nona` is in the executable path.


Usage by example
================

See the example directory:

  * `input.jpg`: Photo made with the 2013 version of the Ricoh Theta

  * `config.json`: Configuration file for *s-anim*

  * `video.mp4`: Video made from output frames

Steps:

 1. Multiply the example image to match the number of frames you want to have:
    000.jpg, 001.jpg, â€¦, 199.jpg

    Alternatively, and possibly more interesting, use a set of frames from a
    video created e.g. with the Ricoh Theta m15.

    Place all input frames into a subdirectory:

        equirectangular

 2. Create a directory for output files:

        stereographic

 3. Create a file `config.json`:

        {
            "input": {
                "path": "equirectangular"
            },
            "output": {
                "width": 480,
                "height": 480,
                "path": "stereographic"
            },
            "interpolation": "polynomial",
            "keyFrames": {}
        }

    Check settings, and adjust as desired.

 4. Specify interpolation method:

      + `linear`: Linear interpolation between keyframes.

      + `polynomial`: Lagrance polynomial interpolation. This is smoother, more
        organic, and somewhat bouncy. Certain keyframe combinations result in
        *overreaction:* The animation temporarily spins far in one direction
        then back. If that happens, try removing keyframes.

    At least one entry needs to be present in the `keyFrames` section. See the
    following steps for how to determine parameters with *Hugin.* Feel free to
    use any other software to determine the key parameters: *field-of-view, yaw,
    pitch,* and *roll*

 5. Open *Hugin,* and add `000.jpg` to the project. Select the image, and
    change *Lens type* to *Equirectangular*. In the *Advanced interface* go to
    *Lens parameters*. Double click on the image file name, and change *Lens
    degrees of view (v)* to 360. Click *OK* to confirm.

 6. Switch to the *Stitcher* tab. As *Projection* select *Stereographic*.
    Adjust the canvas size to the output width and height specified in
    `config.json`. Change *Field of View* to 200, as a start: It defines the
    zoom level. Finally click *Preview panorama*.

 7. In the *Panorama preview*, click *Num. Transf.*, and adjust *Yaw*, *Pitch*,
    and *Roll*. When the Ricoh Theta was upright when shooting the picture, you
    may want to start with changing *Pitch* by 90. This gives a birds eye view.
    Click on the image to quickly adjust pitch and yaw. To zoom in or out,
    change the *Field of View* (previous step).

 8. Close *Panorama preview* and save the project to a file `hugin.pto`.

 9. Open `hugin.pto` in a text editor:

        # hugin project file
        #hugin_ptoversion 2
        p f4 w1500 h1500 v290  E8.14078 R0 n"TIFF_m c:LZW r:CROP"
        m g1 i0 f0 m2 p0.00784314

        # image lines
        #-hugin  cropFactor=8
        i w3584 h1792 f4 v360 Ra0 Rb0 Rc0 Rd0 Re0 Eev8.14078 Er1 Eb1 r-159.92 p7.89 y2.45 TrX0 TrY0 TrZ0 j0 a0 b0 c0 d0 e0 g0 t0 Va1 Vb0 Vc0 Vd0 Vx0 Vy0  Vm5 n"C:\some\path\000.jpg"

    Have a look at the line prefixed with `p`. It contains the selected field
    of view (here: `v290`). Go to the line prefixed with `i`. It contains yaw,
    pitch, and roll (here: `y2.45`, `p7.89`, `r-159.92`).

    Use these parameters to add a key frame in `config.json`:

        "keyFrames": {
            "000.jpg": {
                "fov": 290,
                "roll": -169.197889441657,
                "pitch": -26.8529158401883,
                "yaw": -25.1449433873378
            }
        }

 10. Repeat the above steps for more key frames. Not all parameters need to be
    specified for each key frame.

 11. On the command line, run:

        s-anim

 12. Using a video editing software, convert the frames to a video.
